# Privacy Policy for YouTube Media Controller Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: May 15, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how the YouTube Media Controller Chrome Extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use the Extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## 1. Information We Collect

The Extension collects and processes the following types of information to provide its functionality:

### 1.1. Tab and Media Information
- **Data Collected**: The Extension accesses information about browser tabs that are playing audio or video, including:
  - Tab titles (e.g., video titles).
  - URLs of tabs to identify YouTube videos (specifically, the video ID in the URL).
  - Media metadata, such as the current playback time, duration, and paused state of audio or video elements.
  - Channel names and thumbnail URLs for YouTube videos.
- **Purpose**: This data is used to display media information (e.g., video title, channel name, thumbnail) in the Extension’s popup interface and to enable playback controls (e.g., play/pause, seek, next/previous track, mute).
- **How It’s Collected**: The Extension uses Chrome’s `tabs` and `scripting` APIs to query audible tabs and execute scripts on webpages to extract media information.

### 1.2. Locally Stored Data
- **Data Stored**: The Extension stores the following data locally on your device:
  - The ID of the last playing tab.
  - The last known media information (title, channel name, thumbnail URL) to restore the popup state when reopened.
- **Purpose**: This ensures continuity of the user experience, allowing the Extension to display the last played media’s details even if no audible tabs are currently active.
- **How It’s Stored**: Data is stored in memory during the Extension’s operation and is not persisted to disk or synced across devices.

### 1.3. No Personal Data
- The Extension does **not** collect, store, or process personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address, or IP address) unless explicitly provided by you (e.g., in feedback or support requests).
- The Extension does **not** access or collect sensitive data such as cookies, browsing history beyond the active tab’s URL, or form inputs.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information collected by the Extension is used solely to provide its core functionality, including:
- Displaying media information (title, channel, thumbnail) in the popup interface.
- Enabling media controls (play/pause, next/previous track, mute, seek) for audible tabs.
- Maintaining the state of the last playing tab and media information for a seamless user experience.

We do **not** use your data for advertising, analytics, or any purpose other than delivering the Extension’s functionality.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **No Third-Party Sharing**: The Extension does **not** share, sell, or disclose any collected data to third parties.
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally on your device within the Chrome browser. No data is transmitted to external servers or services.
- **Legal Compliance**: We may disclose data if required by law or to comply with legal processes, but only to the extent necessary and as permitted by applicable regulations.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: All data (e.g., last playing tab ID, media information) is stored locally in your browser’s memory and is cleared when the browser is closed or the Extension is disabled/uninstalled.
- **No Cloud Storage**: The Extension does **not** store data on remote servers or use cloud-based services.
- **Security Measures**: We implement reasonable security practices to protect data within the Extension, such as limiting data collection to what is strictly necessary and processing data locally.

## 5. Permissions

The Extension requires the following Chrome permissions to function:
- **`tabs`**: To detect audible tabs and retrieve tab titles and URLs (e.g., to identify YouTube video IDs).
- **`scripting`**: To execute scripts on webpages to extract media information (e.g., channel names, playback state) and control media (e.g., play/pause, seek).
- **`activeTab`**: To interact with the currently active tab when controlling media.

These permissions are used solely for the Extension’s functionality and are not used to access unrelated data or perform unauthorized actions.

## 6. Third-Party Websites

The Extension interacts with third-party websites (e.g., YouTube) to extract media information and control playback. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these websites. Please review the privacy policies of third-party websites (e.g., YouTube’s Privacy Policy) for information on how they handle your data.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information through the Extension, please contact us, and we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the Extension’s functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. If significant changes are made, we will notify users through the Chrome Web Store or within the Extension (e.g., via a popup notice).
